# Real World ICS Incidents

## Important Names & Companies
- Michael Assante

## ICS Cyber Kill Chain
- Stage 1: Access to the environment
  - Recon
  - Weaponization / Targeting
  - Delivery
  - Exploit
  - Install / Modify
  - C2
  - Act
- Stage 2: Develop insights/knowledge or malicious software
  - Develop
  - Test
  - Deliver
  - Install / Modify
  - Execute ICS attack

- A lot of ICS attacks are not exploit-based

## Incidents

### Electric Power System in Ukraine 2015
- First time a cyber attack caused an electrical outage (67 substations disconnected at distribution level)
- 250.000 people in the dark
- Stage 2: 6 months learning about the environment (looking for assets and found 700 Windos PCs).
- The attackers effectively became remote operators.
- After 6 months the attackers started to disconnect power and uploaded malware to serial-to-ethernet devices.
- Not a scalable attack.

### "CRASHOVERRIDE" (Electric Power System) in Ukraine 2016
- At transmission level
- The attackers leraned from 2015 and made the attack scalable
- Blueprint, not a targeted attack

### 2017

## Problems
- ICS systems become more and more homogeneous -> attacks become scalable and replicatable

## Countermeasures
- We should focus more on behaviours and TTPs instead of anomalies
