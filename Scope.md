# Scoping

## Part 1: Comparative Overview

- Are there attributes of attacks that can be used to differentiate them into two groups?
- Can we come up with two different methodologies with which we can evaluate "all" incidents?

## Part 2: One Attack in Detail

- Easy to scope: Just make sure that we don't choose the same one
- My preferences:
  - TRITON
  - Blackenergy
  - Industroyer/Crashoverride
