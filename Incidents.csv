BlackEnergy,06/2015 - 12/2015,Ukraine,Power Grid,?,ICS (SCADA?),BlackEnergy malware used for recon / No ICS/SCADA protocol or PLC payloads but mostly on the IT side / Initial infiltration via macro documents -> user credential compromise for access and manual manipulation of SCADA controls (HMI/rdesktop) / Firmware attacks (Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) / serial-to-ethernet) / Stage 2: 6 months learning about the environment (looking for assets and found 700 Windows PCs) / The attackers effectively became remote operators / After 6 months (dwell time) the attackers started to disconnect power and uploaded malware to serial-to-ethernet devices,No,?,Yes,Power outage (67 substations disconnected at distribution level) -> 230.000-250.000 people without power in freezing temperatures,medium (at the attack phase),?
Industroyer/CRASHOVERRIDE,2016,Ukraine,Power Grid,ELECTRUM (+?),ICS (SCADA?),Required significant pre-positioning / Many ICS/SCADA protocol payloads / many behaviors on both IT & OT side / Credential capture via Mimikatz (could be detected with a signature-based approach) -> Compromised user accounts & attacker created accounts / Used LoL (?) commands to pivot into ICS/SCADA via Windows LM/SQL / Spoofed ICS/SCADA command messages / At transmission level / Blueprint / not a targeted attack / Infection vector (kill chain stage 1) is unknown,Yes,?,Yes,700.000 people (1/5 of Kiev) without power in freezing temp (?),?,?
Triton/Trisis/Hatman,2017,Saudi Arabia,Petrochemical plant,?,ICS (SCADA?),SIS Tampering: Contained Safety PLC (SPLC) / Safety Instrumented System (SIS) payloads / relied on operator placement & execution / Modified control logic (reprogrammed SPLC/SIS to allow unsafe conditions to persist) / Exploited a vulnerability (injected custom PowerPC payload exploiting a vulnerability in the device firmware to escalate privileges disabling RAM/ROM consistency checking etc.),?,Kill people (?),No,Plant temporarily shut down,?,Shut down of the plant
Norsk Hydro,12/2019,Norway,Production Line,?,?,Ransomware,?,Get ransom payment,?,300M NOK,late (at the consequence phase),?
