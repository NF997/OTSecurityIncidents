\section{Introduction}
% The introduction supplies sufficient background information for the reader to understand and evaluate the work you did. Assume the reader is a generic computer science student, knowledgeable and acquainted with all basic computer science concepts. The introduction should also include a description of the problem you want to solve, your research questions, and an outline for the remainder of your paper. The goal is to: Indicate the field of the work, why this field is important, and what has already been done (with proper citations), Outline the purpose of your paper and announce your research questions, Avoid: repeating the abstract; providing unnecessary background information.
% ICS
% OT Security <-> IT Security: very recent trend, first incidents
% Problem: No overview; Contribution: Overview
% Benefits of an overview: Helps to identify patterns and to prevent future incidents (?)
% Triton
