# Triton/Trisis/Hatman

- Timeframe: 2017 in Saudi Arabia
- A lot of information about this incident is incorrect
- Petrochemical plant operated by Saudi Aramco and Sumitomo Chemical
- Attack was designed to kill people
- Attacker got a second chance and failed again
- Attacker was in the network for years and were only discovered due to a bug in their code which led to a shut down of the plant for one week
- Attacker used RDP to pivot from the IT network to the OT network
- Attacker inserted a remote access trojan (RAT) into the safety controllers using standard PLC programming functions
- Contained Safety PLC (SPLC) / Safety Instrumented System (SIS) payloads, relied on operator placement & execution
- Modified control logic (reprogrammed SPLC/SIS to allow unsafe conditions to persist)
- Exploited a vulnerability (injected custom PowerPC payload exploiting a vulnerability in the device firmware to escalate privileges disabling RAM/ROM consistency checking etc.)
- Possible prevention:
  - Asset Inventory
  - Vulnerability Management Software
  - Anomaly/Incident Detection System (based on TTPs and behaviours, not only IOCs)
  - Threat Hunting
  - Security Awareness
  - Firewalls
  - Patching (hard)
  - Network Segmentation (hard, but choke-points usually in place by default)
